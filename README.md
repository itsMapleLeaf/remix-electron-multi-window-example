# remix-electron-template

Welcome to your new remix-electron project!

## Scripts

- `prepare`: This sets up remix dependencies after an install. Don't remove this!
- `dev`: Starts the app with hot reloading. Uses nodemon to restart the app when main process files change.
- `build`: Builds the app for production. Uses [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) to create a distributable package.
- `start`: Starts the app in production mode. Make sure you ran `build` first.
